# Clean Object Writing
The aim of this project is to have an Apple Shortcut on my phone that fetches the current [Word of the Day](https://objectwriting.com/) and automatically starts a 10 minute timer. Since it's not easily possible to extract data from webpages in a shortcut, I wrote a small serverless function that returns the current word.

## Download
You can download the current version of this shortcut [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/eb058ec96a3b4cce9a8a771a7f41d7f5) where you can also customize the API endpoint.
